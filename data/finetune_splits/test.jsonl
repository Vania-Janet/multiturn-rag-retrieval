In Code Engine, you can store your information as key-value pairs in configmaps that can be consumed by your job or application by using environment variables.\n\n\n\n What are configmaps and why would I use them? \n\nIn Code Engine, both secrets and configmaps are key-value pairs. When mapped to environment variables, the NAME=VALUE relationships are set such that the name of the environment variable corresponds to the \"key\" of each entry in those maps, and the value of the environment variable is the \"value\" of that key.\n\nA configmap provides a method to include non-sensitive data information to your deployment. By referencing values from your configmap as environment variables, you can decouple specific information from your deployment and keep your app or job portable. A configmap contains information in key-value pairs.\n\nBecause secrets and configmaps are similar entities (except secrets are stored more securely), the way you interact and work with secrets and configmaps is also similar. To learn more about secrets, see [Working with secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-secret).\n\n\n\n\n\n I see configmaps that I didn't create.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups.

{"query": "how does web chat work?", "positive": "\nHow the web chat works \n\nThe web chat provides an easy-to-use chatbot interface that you can add to your website without writing any code.\n\nAfter you add the web chat script to your website, your customers will see a launcher icon that they can click to open the chat window and start a conversation with the assistant. The appearance of the launcher icon adapts to desktop and mobile browsers.\n\n![web chat launcher in desktop browser](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/web-chat-desktop-highlighted.png)\n\nWhen a customer clicks the launcher, the web chat window opens, initially displaying the home screen. The home screen displays a greeting and an optional set of suggested conversation starters for common questions and problems. The customer can either click a conversation starter or type a message in the input field to start the conversation with the assistant.\n\n![web chat example home screen](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/web-chat-home-screen-lendyr.png)\n\nThe appearance and behavior of the launcher icon, the home screen, and most other aspects of the web chat can be configured and customized to match your website style and branding.

The locale setting affects how values such as dates and times are formatted.\n\nTo configure the web chat for customers outside the US, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.

RS256 cryptography is a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures."}

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "negative": "\nIf the problem persists, open an IBM Cloud support case.\n\nSee the troubleshooting topic on [File storage and block storage: PVC remains in a pending state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_pvc_pending) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n After I deploy a node, I'm seeing a message in my Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud reporting that the pod has hit a crash loop backoff.

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "negative": "\nFor a complete list of the options and setup information, see [Advanced password management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-strengthcd-advanced-password). \n\n\n\nThese features are available only to those instances that are on the graduated tier pricing plan and that were created after 15 March 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n When am I charged? \n\nYour first 1000 authentication events and 1000 authorized users per service instance are free of charge.

(It hasn't been updated for 2014 yet, so mentally shift all the years in the publication up by one year when you read it.) Since you don't have a green card, whether you are a resident is determined by the Substantial Presence Test.

See, for starters at least, http://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch04.html. The gist of it is: If you use the car 100% for business purposes, you NEVER use it to drive to the grocery store or to your friend's house, etc, then it is a deductible business expense. If you use a car party for business use and partly for personal use, than you can deduct the portion of the expense of the car that is for business use, but not the portion that is for personal use. So basically, if you use the car 75% for business purposes and 25% for personal use, you can deduct 75% of the cost and expenses. You can calculate the business use by, (a) Keeping careful records of how much you spent on gas, oil, repairs, etc, tracking the percentage of business use versus percentage of personal use, and then multiplying the cost by the percentage business use and that is the amount you can deduct; or (b) Use the standard mileage allowance, so many cents per mile, which changes every year. Note that the fact that you paid for the car from a business account has absolutely nothing to do with it. (If it did, then everyone could create a small business, open a business account, pay all their bills from there, and all their personal expenses would magically become business expenses.) Just by the way: If you are going to try to stretch the rules on your taxes, business use of a car or personal computer or expenses for a home office are the worst place to do it. The IRS knows that cars and computers are things that can easily be used for either personal or business purposes and so they keep a special eye out on these."}

{"query": "Is refinancing the same as getting a mortgage?", "positive": "\n\"A re-financing, or re-fi, is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one. This can be done for several reasons; usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment. Debt consolidation (taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller, higher-interest loans that rack up, like credit card debt, medical bills, etc) is a form of refinancing, but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage, as in your example. To answer your questions, most of the money comes from a new bank. That bank understands up front that this is a re-fi and not \"\"new debt\"\"; the homeowner isn't asking for any additional money, but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt. Therefore, the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal. Even then, a re-fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get (at least on terms he'd be willing to take). First off, if the homeowner owes more than the home's worth, a re-fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan. The bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy (a new house is a HUGE ding on your credit score, trust me), or the market and the homeowner's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner. The homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage, which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest; however, the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years, or ever. To answer the question of why a bank would do this, there are several reasons: The bank offering the re-fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage. This new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank, and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan.", "negative": "\nWhen getting a mortgage it always depends on the bank and each bank may be more or less strict. With that being said there are rules and general guidelines which can help you understand how you fit in the world of mortgage approvals.

{"query": "Is refinancing the same as getting a mortgage?", "positive": "\n\"A re-financing, or re-fi, is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one. This can be done for several reasons; usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment. Debt consolidation (taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller, higher-interest loans that rack up, like credit card debt, medical bills, etc) is a form of refinancing, but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage, as in your example. To answer your questions, most of the money comes from a new bank. That bank understands up front that this is a re-fi and not \"\"new debt\"\"; the homeowner isn't asking for any additional money, but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt. Therefore, the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal. Even then, a re-fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get (at least on terms he'd be willing to take). First off, if the homeowner owes more than the home's worth, a re-fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan. The bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy (a new house is a HUGE ding on your credit score, trust me), or the market and the homeowner's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner. The homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage, which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest; however, the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years, or ever. To answer the question of why a bank would do this, there are several reasons: The bank offering the re-fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage. This new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank, and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan.", "negative": "\nWhat do I need to know if I'm unemployed and need to take out a home loan to finance a litigious divorce?

{"query": "Is refinancing the same as getting a mortgage?", "positive": "\n\"A mortgage is simply a loan backed by a property (and, because it's both very large and very common, covered by some specific laws). As such, the bank isn't an \"\"investor\"\" in your house; it simply is lending you money with the property as collateral. So, it doesn't get any share of the profit. As long as you sell the house on your own, for more than you owe, most of the time in the US you will get about 92-94% of the sale price back, minus whatever you owe on the house. The 6-8% you don't get will go to the realtors as commission (unless you sell by owner and don't sell to someone with a buyer's agent), and to pay some of the costs of the sale (how much of those you pay depends on the deal you make with the buyer, but it's common to pay some of them in some areas). You also will owe taxes (potentially). You then pay the bank back from that amount. As such, in your example, let's say Bob owes $50k on his house, and sells it with a realtor for $150k. He gets $150k-0.06*150k = 141k after commission. He then hands the bank a check for the current payoff of the loan: that amount is usually slightly higher than the remaining principal, because you owe the interest that's accrued between [last payment you made] and [day of sale]. Let's say this is a 6% loan, which works out to around 0.5% per month, and it's been half a month since his last payment, so he owes another 0.25%, or another $125. Some mortgages also may have prepayment penalties (check your note). In this case there isn't a penalty, so the bank gets $50,125 from the sale. Usually, the bank would get that immediately at closing - ie, he doesn't get the full $141k or $150k and then write a check, instead the title/closing company gets that amount, and gives the $9k to the realtors, the $50,125 to the bank, and the remaining $90,875 to him.", "negative": "\nWhen getting a mortgage it always depends on the bank and each bank may be more or less strict.

If you are pregnant and have HIV or AIDS, you can pass HIV to your baby during pregnancy or childbirth. But, there are medicines you can take to greatly lower the chance that your baby will get HIV.\nYou can also pass HIV to your baby during breastfeeding. If you have HIV, you should not breastfeed your baby.\nWhen will I know if my baby has HIV?\nThere are two kinds of tests that should be given to babies born to women with HIV to find out if they have HIV. The first test is call the HIV antibody test. All babies born to women with HIV will test positive for the first several months of their lives with the HIV antibody test. But this does not mean that they really have HIV. It means that the baby has been exposed to his/her mother's HIV. The second test, the PCR test, looks for the virus and not just the antibodies to the virus, and can tell whether the baby really has HIV or not. The first PCR test should be done in the first few days of life. More PCR tests will be done by the baby's doctor in the first few weeks and months of life. The PCR test is a very important test. It can tell for certain whether or not a baby has HIV by the time she is three to six months old.\nWhat can I do for a healthy pregnancy?\nYou and your baby will need special medical care. It is important to take good care of yourself while you are pregnant. Work with your doctor and other care providers so you can have a healthy baby. Start by asking your doctor:\n\nAre HIV medicines right for me?\nWhat's my viral load?\nWhen should I start HIV medicines?\nHow should I take my HIV medicines?\nCan I take other medicine with my HIV medicines?\nShould I have a C-section delivery?\nWhen should my baby be tested for HIV?\nHow should I choose a doctor for my baby?\n\nHere are some things you can do for yourself and your baby:\n\nGet early and regular prenatal care."}

Some courses may be taught by volunteers free of charge.\nStudents will receive a temporary boating safety certificate upon completion of the course.\nPermanent boating safety certificates do not expire.\n\nFees\nCourses are taught by volunteer or paid instructors. Volunteers are free of charge, but an instructor may charge a fee for the course. Fees may vary.\nStudents 18 years of age and older will be required to pay a $10 fee to NYS for issuance of a permanent boating safety certificate.\nCost for a replacement certificate is $10.00 regardless of age\nHow do I find out if there is a fee for the class?", "negative": "\r\n\tBoating Frequently Asked Questions - NYS Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation\r\n\nWe do not have all course records prior to 2000. Any certificate issued prior to 2000 is only acceptable if you have a copy of it and you were under 18 years of age when it was issued. All NYS boating safety certificates issued\r\n\tafter 2000, regardless of age, are acceptable.\nI took course prior to 2000, but lost my certificate - what should I do?\r\n\tUnfortunately, we do not have records for all students who took the course prior to the year 2000. Search for your record online at ilostmycard.com. You can also email us at boating@parks.ny.gov with your name and date of birth to search for your record. If your record is not found, you will need to retake the course to obtain a certificate.\nCan I use my NY safety certificate in other states?\r\n\tYes, because the New York Safe Boating Certificate is nationally accredited and valid in other states and Canada. Please note that the Adventure License is not acceptable proof of a safe boating certificate outside of New York State.\nI'm visiting New York. Will my safety certificate from my home state be sufficient?\r\n\tYes, provided it was issued from your current state of residence, and the course was approved by the National Association of Boating Law Administrators. Look for the NASBLA logo on your certificate.\nI just bought a motor boat; will I need a course immediately?\r\n\tIn 2024, if you were born January 1, 1978 or later, you will need a certificate before you can legally operate the boat. Starting in 2025, everyone, regardless of age, will need a certificate before they can legally operate their boat.\nWill I need a course in order to rent a motorboat in New York?\r\n\tNo. If you are at least 18 years old, you may rent without completing a course. The livery must demonstrate how to properly use the boat before renting it. Persons under the age of 18 may only rent a motorboat if they hold a \r\n\tsafety certificate.\nI lost my safety certificate. How can I get a replacement?\r\n\tYou can order your replacement certificate online at https://www.ilostmycard.com/\nWhat if I lost my temporary certificate?"}

A positive antibody test result can be used to help identify people who may have had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or prior COVID-19. An antibody test does not show if you have a current SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 because the antibodies are part of the body's immune response to infection, and antibody tests do not test for the virus itself.

In addition, Juno’s radio signal is used to measure Jupiter’s gravity field and upper atmosphere, and those of three of Jupiter’s four Galilean satellites.Q: What significant discoveries has Juno made? A: Juno is shedding light on Jupiter’s internal structure, showing that bands in the planet’s colorful, turbulent atmosphere descend far below the cloud tops, and that its mammoth magnetic field is even larger and more powerful than predicted. It has also revealed the size of Jupiter’s core, and helped scientists understand the amount of oxygen in the planet’s chemical makeup, which previously was a key missing ingredient for helping explain how the planet formed.Q: How long will the Juno mission last? A: The Juno mission, originally slated to explore Jupiter from 2016-2017, was extended by NASA, and is now scheduled to end in September 2025.Q: What will happen to Juno at the end of the mission?"}

Next to go, NASA’s Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch in October 2024, and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030. For Juno, exploring the full Jovian system, passing through the doughnut-shaped clouds of charged particles surrounding Europa, Io, and the other moons, testing the radiation environment, studying the dust in Jupiter’s faint rings – all this work and more will inform the mission designs, science priorities, observation strategies, and more for Europa Clipper, Juice, and others that will surely follow. Jupiter ExplorationJuno continues a lineage of discovery at the king of planets, and is helping prepare the next generation of missions bound for Jupiter.More About Jupiter ExplorationContinuing a LegacyJuno builds on the work of previous missions to Jupiter, and paves the way for its successors.

{"query": "What is the difference?", "positive": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits\nThere are essentially three types of Earth orbits: high Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, and low Earth orbit. Many weather and some communications satellites tend to have a high Earth orbit, farthest away from the surface. Satellites that orbit in a medium (mid) Earth orbit include navigation and specialty satellites, designed to monitor a particular region. Most scientific satellites, including NASA’s Earth Observing System fleet, have a low Earth orbit.\n\nOne way of classifying orbits is by altitude. Low Earth orbit starts just above the top of the atmosphere, while high Earth orbit begins about one tenth of the way to the moon. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon)\n\nThe height of the orbit, or distance between the satellite and Earth’s surface, determines how quickly the satellite moves around the Earth. An Earth-orbiting satellite’s motion is mostly controlled by Earth’s gravity. As satellites get closer to Earth, the pull of gravity gets stronger, and the satellite moves more quickly. NASA’s Aqua satellite, for example, requires about 99 minutes to orbit the Earth at about 705 kilometers up, while a weather satellite about 36,000 kilometers from Earth’s surface takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to complete an orbit. At 384,403 kilometers from the center of the Earth, the Moon completes a single orbit in 28 days.\n\nThe higher a satellite’s orbit, the slower it moves.

The length of each red arrow in this diagram represents the distance traveled by a satellite in an hour. View animation. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon.)\n\nChanging a satellite’s height will also change its orbital speed. This introduces a strange paradox. If a satellite operator wants to increase the satellite’s orbital speed, he can’t simply fire the thrusters to accelerate the satellite. Doing so would boost the orbit (increase the altitude), which would slow the orbital speed.

An identity thief can use the information he or she learns about you on social media sites to answer “challenge” questions and potentially gain access to your personal accounts. Monitor your privacy settings and consider limiting access to your page to a small number of people.\nA Virtual Private Network for public networks. Consider purchasing and using a reputable Virtual Private Network or VPN software to use while online using public networks. Virtual Private Networks provide an additional layer of security for you and your information while using potentially unsafe internet connections.\nIdentity Theft Prevention Tips for Parents with Children \n\nWe live in the age of screens.

Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can’t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft’s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.

Health care workers with a history of worsening latex allergy symptoms should be especially cautious.\nWho is at risk?\nThose at risk include people whose job or medical status puts them in frequent direct contact with latex. Health care workers and dental workers are those most often exposed to latex, principally by using latex gloves that are powdered to make them easier to put on. The powder binds with the latex proteins and becomes airborne. It can then be inhaled and cause an allergic response. People at increased risk include:\n\nmultiple allergy sufferers;\nchildren with spina bifida or multiple surgeries at an early age;\nhealth care workers: doctors, nurses, surgical staff, dentists, dental hygienists, emergency medical services personnel, lab technicians;\npeople who undergo frequent medical procedures such as catheterization;\nanyone working in the latex rubber industry (tire factories, rubber manufacturing and glove manufacturing);\nchild care providers;\nfood service workers;\nhousekeeping staff in and outside health care facilities;\nlaw enforcement professionals;\nfirefighters;\nfuneral home employees;\nhairdressers;\npeople with a history of worsening allergic reaction to foods known to cross react (see below) with natural rubber latex.\n\nWhat is a cross reaction?\nPeople allergic to latex may also be allergic to similar proteins found in some food items. This is called a cross reaction. When this occurs, your body responds with the same allergic symptoms that you would have if you were exposed to latex. Cross reactions differ from one individual to another. Someone may have a reaction to all the foods noted to cause cross reaction while another may have no reaction at all. Likewise, if you are allergic to any of the food items listed below, you may also be allergic to latex.

People allergic to these foods have been known to have cross allergic reactions during surgery.\nWhat foods may cause a cross reaction?\nFollowing are some foods that may cause a cross reaction:\n\napples, bananas, kiwi, peaches, plums, figs, grapes, melons, papaya, passion fruit, cherries, nectarines, pears, pineapple and strawberries;\ncarrots, celery, raw potatoes, avocados and tomatoes;\nchestnuts and hazelnuts;\nwheat and rye.\n\nWhat can I do to reduce the risk of developing an allergy to latex?\n\nIf you work in a job that exposes you to latex, take advantage of all latex allergy education and training provided by your employer. Become familiar with procedures for preventing latex allergy. Learn the symptoms of latex allergy.\nUse nonlatex gloves for activities that are not likely to involve contact with infectious material (food preparation and housekeeping).\nIf latex gloves are used, powder-free gloves with reduced protein content may reduce the risk of developing an allergy to latex.\nWhen wearing latex gloves, do not use oil-based hand creams or lotions (which can cause glove deterioration).\nAfter removing latex gloves, wash hands with mild soap and dry them thoroughly.\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect I have a latex allergy?\n\nAvoid contact with latex products.\nBe evaluated by a physician experienced in diagnosing latex allergy.\n\nWhat are some things I can do to protect myself if I am allergic to latex?\n\nAvoid contact with natural rubber latex products.\nIf you have to wear gloves in your work, ask your employer for nonlatex gloves.\nAvoid areas where you might inhale the powder from latex gloves worn by other workers.\nWear a personal medical emergency ID bracelet.", "negative": "Latex Allergy Information\nThe risk of anaphylactic shock seems to be greatest in people who have had previous allergic reactions to products that contain latex or prior unexplained anaphylaxis. Health care workers with a history of worsening latex allergy symptoms should be especially cautious.\nWho is at risk?\nThose at risk include people whose job or medical status puts them in frequent direct contact with latex. Health care workers and dental workers are those most often exposed to latex, principally by using latex gloves that are powdered to make them easier to put on. The powder binds with the latex proteins and becomes airborne. It can then be inhaled and cause an allergic response. People at increased risk include:\n\nmultiple allergy sufferers;\nchildren with spina bifida or multiple surgeries at an early age;\nhealth care workers: doctors, nurses, surgical staff, dentists, dental hygienists, emergency medical services personnel, lab technicians;\npeople who undergo frequent medical procedures such as catheterization;\nanyone working in the latex rubber industry (tire factories, rubber manufacturing and glove manufacturing);\nchild care providers;\nfood service workers;\nhousekeeping staff in and outside health care facilities;\nlaw enforcement professionals;\nfirefighters;\nfuneral home employees;\nhairdressers;\npeople with a history of worsening allergic reaction to foods known to cross react (see below) with natural rubber latex.\n\nWhat is a cross reaction?\nPeople allergic to latex may also be allergic to similar proteins found in some food items. This is called a cross reaction. When this occurs, your body responds with the same allergic symptoms that you would have if you were exposed to latex. Cross reactions differ from one individual to another. Someone may have a reaction to all the foods noted to cause cross reaction while another may have no reaction at all.

But this does not mean that they really have HIV. It means that the baby has been exposed to his/her mother's HIV. The second test, the PCR test, looks for the virus and not just the antibodies to the virus, and can tell whether the baby really has HIV or not. The first PCR test should be done in the first few days of life. More PCR tests will be done by the baby's doctor in the first few weeks and months of life. The PCR test is a very important test. It can tell for certain whether or not a baby has HIV by the time she is three to six months old.\nWhat can I do for a healthy pregnancy?\nYou and your baby will need special medical care.

Skywatching refers to observing the ever-changing variety of sights in the sky, at night in particular, but also in the day. Skywatching can be as casual as enjoying a couple of minutes of stargazing, and as serious as using a telescope to take images of deep sky objects. When you notice the changing position and phases of the Moon over a few days, or you search for Jupiter or Venus in the twilight sky, or you notice a constellation like Orion is visible for the first time in a few months, you're skywatching. At its heart, skywatching is an activity anyone can engage in to feel more connected to the larger world beyond planet Earth.What tools do I need to start skywatching?You don't need any special equipment to get started skywatching. Online resources like this page are a great place to learn about what you can see. An app on your smartphone or computer can be a great help to discover what sights are visible tonight, and where to find them in the sky once you're outside under the stars. If you have access to binoculars or a telescope, they will extend your vision and enhance the experience – but they are by no means necessary to get started. How do I find a good location for skywatching or stargazing?The number one priority when seeking an excellent location for skywatching is to get away from bright city lights. Scattered light from urban areas creates light pollution that washes out the fainter stars and the Milky Way. Wide open areas without lots of tall trees or mountains nearby make for good viewing spots, since you can see more of the sky."}

When you notice the changing position and phases of the Moon over a few days, or you search for Jupiter or Venus in the twilight sky, or you notice a constellation like Orion is visible for the first time in a few months, you're skywatching. At its heart, skywatching is an activity anyone can engage in to feel more connected to the larger world beyond planet Earth.Q: What tools do I need to start skywatching?You don't need any special equipment to get started skywatching. Online resources like this page are a great place to learn about what you can see. An app on your smartphone or computer can be a great help to discover what sights are visible tonight, and where to find them in the sky once you're outside under the stars. If you have access to binoculars or a telescope, they will extend your vision and enhance the experience – but they are by no means necessary to get started. Q: How do I find a good location for skywatching or stargazing?The number one priority when seeking an excellent location for skywatching is to get away from bright city lights. Scattered light from urban areas creates light pollution that washes out the fainter stars and the Milky Way. Wide open areas without lots of tall trees or mountains nearby make for good viewing spots, since you can see more of the sky. Examples include places like a large field, a wide valley, and the shore of a lake or the ocean.

How do I know if objects and events described here are visible where I live? Most skywatching phenomena featured on these webpages and in our What's Up videos are visible for observers across the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (that is, from about 25° to 50° north latitude). Plenty of these highlights are also visible from other locations farther north and south.If an object like a star or planet appears high overhead for the U.S. mainland, then it will also appear high overhead across much of Europe, the Mediterranean and Middle East, and Eastern Asia. These regions share the same range of latitudes, so their view of the night sky is similar.We recommend using skywatching apps for mobile devices and computers for determining if something can be seen from your location, and when to look for it. They enable you to enter your location on Earth and see the sky as it will look on a particular date and time.How big is a \"degree\" when describing how close objects appear in the sky? A degree is about the with of your little finger held at arm's length. Most of us are familiar with the idea that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that making a 180-degree turn is to face the opposite direction. If you imagine the sky as a sphere with the stars fixed onto it and pick any point, and draw a circle all the way around the sky until you return to that point, you will have rotated through 360 degrees.
