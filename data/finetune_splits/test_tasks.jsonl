Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported.\n\nFor more information about supported versions and update actions that you must take to move from one version to another, see [Kubernetes version information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions)\n* Which worker node operating systems does the service support?\n\nFor a list of supported worker node operated systems by cluster version, see [Kubernetes version information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).\n* Where is the service available?\n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is available worldwide. You can create clusters in every supported IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service region.\n\nFor more information about supported regions, see [Locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zonesregions-and-zones).\n* Is the service highly available?\n\nYes. By default, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service sets up many components such as the cluster master with replicas, anti-affinity, and other options to increase the high availability (HA) of the service. You can increase the redundancy and failure toleration of your cluster worker nodes, storage, networking, and workloads by configuring them in a highly available architecture. For an overview of the default setup and your options to increase HA, see [High availability for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha).", "domain": "mixed"}

The basic example does not include the code to define all of the necessary event handlers for the connection.\n\nvar access_token = {access_token};\nvar wsURI = '{ws_url}/v1/recognize'\n+ '?access_token=' + access_token;\nvar websocket = new WebSocket(wsURI);\n\nwebsocket.onopen = function(evt) { onOpen(evt) };\n\nfunction onOpen(evt) {\nvar message = {\naction: 'start',\ncontent-type: 'audio/flac'\n};\nwebsocket.send(JSON.stringify(message));\nwebsocket.send(blob);\nwebsocket.send(JSON.stringify({action: 'stop'}));\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the synchronous HTTP interface \n\n[The synchronous HTTP interface](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-http) provides the simplest way to make a recognition request. You use the POST /v1/recognize method to make a request to the service. You pass the audio and all parameters with the single request.

If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "domain": "mixed"}

In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "domain": "mixed"}

Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "domain": "mixed"}

In some counties lawyers are required, in some not. Check your local requirements. Similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and disbursing of money. You will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service (I'm guessing here, but it makes sense to me). You will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company, and it might be hard without an agent. Agents required by law to know all the details of the process, and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into. They have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports, they know what to demand from the seller (disclosures, information, etc), they know how and from where to get the HOA docs and disclosures, and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information (comparable sales, comparable listings, list vs sales statistics, etc). It is hard to do all that alone, but if you do - you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5% (the agents' fees are up to 5% mostly).

This program ($2.75 million) provides three-year grants to local jurisdictions to\r\nincrease staffing for local code enforcement activities. The maximum grant amount is $1 million, and local matching funds must\r\nincrease over the life of the grant.\n Community Code Enforcement Pilot Program. This program ($2.25 million), with a maximum grant amount of $450,000,\r\nemphasizes improving cooperation between code enforcement officials and prosecution agencies, health departments, housing\r\nagencies, and schools.\n\nInterregional Partnership Pilot Program. This program, funded at $5 million, will provide grants to assist local governments\r\nundertaking interregional planning for housing and employment issues, with a particular emphasis on improving geographic mapping.\nChild Care Facilities. The budget appropriated $16 million for the Child Care Facilities Financing Program.

The 2000-01 budget contained $39 million for two components of EHAP:\n\nOperating Grants. $14 million of the funds are available to fund the ongoing services of homeless shelters. This level of funding\r\nis again proposed for 2001-02.\nCapital Loans. Forgivable loans totaling $25 million are available for the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of shelter\r\nfacilities.\n\nOther Programs \nCode Enforcement Incentives. Two new programs\u2014designed to improve local enforcement of building codes\u2014were created by\r\nChapter 664, Statutes of 2000 (AB 1382, Lowenthal), and appropriated $5 million in one-time funds. The department has received\r\nabout $30 million in applications for the two programs.\n\nCode Enforcement Incentive Program. This program ($2.75 million) provides three-year grants to local jurisdictions to\r\nincrease staffing for local code enforcement activities. The maximum grant amount is $1 million, and local matching funds must\r\nincrease over the life of the grant.\n Community Code Enforcement Pilot Program. This program ($2.25 million), with a maximum grant amount of $450,000,\r\nemphasizes improving cooperation between code enforcement officials and prosecution agencies, health departments, housing\r\nagencies, and schools.\n\nInterregional Partnership Pilot Program. This program, funded at $5 million, will provide grants to assist local governments\r\nundertaking interregional planning for housing and employment issues, with a particular emphasis on improving geographic mapping.\nChild Care Facilities. The budget appropriated $16 million for the Child Care Facilities Financing Program. The funds can be\r\nused for either direct loans or loan guarantees for child care facility purchases, expansions, or renovations.

Additionally, transmission can occur from those with mild symptoms or from those who do not feel ill.\nThere are certain circumstances that can increase the risk of infection for COVID-19 such as poorly ventilated space. In indoor spaces with poor ventilation, the concentration of virus particles is often higher than outdoors.2,3 Other factors that are associated with increased COVID-19 risk include prolonged exposure to those infected with COVID-19, close contact with infected persons, and any other activity that leads to exposure to a greater amount of respiratory droplets and particles.\nSymptoms\nA wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 have been reported.4 These symptoms include:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nMuscle or body aches\nAnorexia\nSore throat\nNasal congestion or runny nose\nHeadache\nDiarrhea\nNausea\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nLoss of smell or taste\n\nThe estimated incubation period is between 2 and 14 days with a median of 5 days.

A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons. Respiratory droplets can land on hands, objects, or surfaces around the person when they cough or talk, and people can then become infected with COVID-19 from touching hands, objects or surfaces with droplets and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Additionally, transmission can occur from those with mild symptoms or from those who do not feel ill.\nThere are certain circumstances that can increase the risk of infection for COVID-19 such as poorly ventilated space. In indoor spaces with poor ventilation, the concentration of virus particles is often higher than outdoors.2,3 Other factors that are associated with increased COVID-19 risk include prolonged exposure to those infected with COVID-19, close contact with infected persons, and any other activity that leads to exposure to a greater amount of respiratory droplets and particles.\nSymptoms\nA wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 have been reported.4 These symptoms include:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nMuscle or body aches\nAnorexia\nSore throat\nNasal congestion or runny nose\nHeadache\nDiarrhea\nNausea\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nLoss of smell or taste\n\nThe estimated incubation period is between 2 and 14 days with a median of 5 days. It is important to note that some people become infected and do not develop any symptoms or feel ill.\nPeople at Higher Risk for Severe Illness\nCOVID-19 is a relatively new disease; therefore, additional risk factors for severe COVID-19 may continue to be identified. In some cases, people who get COVID-19 can develop severe complications, including difficulty breathing, causing a need for hospitalization and intensive care. 5 These severe complications often lead to death.", "domain": "mixed"}

{"task_id": "hf_test_422", "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "do i need any equipment"}], "ground_truth_text": "Skywatching - NASA Science\nWide open areas without lots of tall trees or mountains nearby make for good viewing spots, since you can see more of the sky. Examples include\u00a0places like a large field, a wide valley, and the shore of a lake or the ocean. Any location you select should be a place where you can feel safe at night.> More about finding a good skywatching locationQ: What can I see in the night sky?The whole universe is accessible to skywatchers. Your own eyes will show you stars, a handful of bright planets, the Moon, comets and meteors (shooting stars), to name a few sights. Binoculars or a small telescope enable you to see finer details than your eyes can detect, making visible things like the large moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, as well as star clusters and double stars. A larger telescope enables you to see fainter objects, like nebulas and other galaxies.Q: How does light pollution affect skywatching?Light pollution is stray light from parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other human activity, scattered into the night sky. It's a combined effect of scattered light from these things that manifests as a glow in the night sky that makes it difficult to observe fainter stars and the Milky Way.

Many weather and some communications satellites tend to have a high Earth orbit, farthest away from the surface. Satellites that orbit in a medium (mid) Earth orbit include navigation and specialty satellites, designed to monitor a particular region. Most scientific satellites, including NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System fleet, have a low Earth orbit.\n\nOne way of classifying orbits is by altitude. Low Earth orbit starts just above the top of the atmosphere, while high Earth orbit begins about one tenth of the way to the moon. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon)\n\nThe height of the orbit, or distance between the satellite and Earth\u2019s surface, determines how quickly the satellite moves around the Earth. An Earth-orbiting satellite\u2019s motion is mostly controlled by Earth\u2019s gravity. As satellites get closer to Earth, the pull of gravity gets stronger, and the satellite moves more quickly. NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite, for example, requires about 99 minutes to orbit the Earth at about 705 kilometers up, while a weather satellite about 36,000 kilometers from Earth\u2019s surface takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to complete an orbit. At 384,403 kilometers from the center of the Earth, the Moon completes a single orbit in 28 days.\n\nThe higher a satellite\u2019s orbit, the slower it moves. Certain orbital altitudes have special properties, like a geosynchronous orbit, in which a satellite travels around the Earth exactly once each day. The length of each red arrow in this diagram represents the distance traveled by a satellite in an hour. View animation. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon.)\n\nChanging a satellite\u2019s height will also change its orbital speed. This introduces a strange paradox. If a satellite operator wants to increase the satellite\u2019s orbital speed, he can\u2019t simply fire the thrusters to accelerate the satellite. Doing so would boost the orbit (increase the altitude), which would slow the orbital speed.

You will use mirrors to move the laser and avoid obstacles to get the data back to Earth. Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can\u2019t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft\u2019s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.

If someone who is sensitive to this protein comes in contact with it by touching or breathing it, an allergic reaction can occur.

Some other chemicals used in the manufacture of gloves may also cause sensitization and serious reactions, particularly skin reactions.\nWhat items contain natural rubber latex?\nLatex is used in a variety of products. Many everyday items contain latex but not all brands of all these items always contain latex. Check labels or contact the manufacturer. Following are examples of some products that may contain latex:\n\nmedical devices, such as gloves, syringes, blood pressure cuffs, bandages, IV tubes and catheters;\ndental items, such as toothbrushes with rubber grips, irrigation tips, dams, orthodontic rubber bands and elastic;\nclothing items, such as the elastic waistband in pants, underwear, sneakers, socks and pantyhose, swimsuits;\nchildren's items such as bottle nipples, diapers, rubber pants, pacifiers, teething toys, infant gum massagers and toys;\nhousehold items such as flooring, rug mats, bathmats, rubber gloves, tires and mats;\npersonal care items such as diaphragms, condoms and adult diapers;\noffice supplies such as rubber bands and erasers;\nschool supplies such as erasers, rubber cement and paint.\n\nHow common is an allergy to natural rubber latex?\nIt is difficult to determine just how widespread a problem latex allergy may be.

A larger telescope enables you to see fainter objects, like nebulas and other galaxies.Q: How does light pollution affect skywatching?Light pollution is stray light from parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other human activity, scattered into the night sky. It's a combined effect of scattered light from these things that manifests as a glow in the night sky that makes it difficult to observe fainter stars and the Milky Way. The larger and more developed a city is, the more light pollution it tends to produce. The effect decreases the farther away you travel from a city. Heading out to less developed areas, away from town, will enable you to see more stars.> More about finding a good skywatching locationQ: How can I involve my children in skywatching?Parents can prepare to involve their children in skywatching by learning some of the basics, like the phases of the Moon, the names of a few easy to recognize constellations, and knowing how to identify bright stars and planets using a favorite astronomy app. Staying up to date with the month's skywatching highlights, with resources like NASA's What's Up video series, makes it easy to know what there is to observe, and provides some fun facts to share when out under the stars.", "domain": "mixed"}

How do I know if objects and events described here are visible where I live? Most skywatching phenomena featured on these webpages and in our What's Up videos are visible for observers across the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (that is, from about 25\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 north latitude). Plenty of these highlights are also visible from other locations farther north and south.If an object like a star or planet appears high overhead for the U.S. mainland, then it will also appear high overhead across much of Europe, the Mediterranean and Middle East, and Eastern Asia. These regions share the same range of latitudes, so their view of the night sky is similar.We recommend using skywatching apps for mobile devices and computers for determining if something can be seen from your location, and when to look for it. They enable you to enter your location on Earth and see the sky as it will look on a particular date and time.How big is a \"degree\" when describing how close objects appear in the sky? A degree is about the with of your little finger held at arm's length. Most of us are familiar with the idea that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that making a 180-degree turn is to face the opposite direction. If you imagine the sky as a sphere with the stars fixed onto it and pick any point, and draw a circle all the way around the sky until you return to that point, you will have rotated through 360 degrees. To approximate 5 degrees, hold up your three middle fingers on one hand.", "domain": "mixed"}
