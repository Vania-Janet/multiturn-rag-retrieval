After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries.

You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application? \n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications."}

If you did delete it, don't panic. You can add it back. Just add a dialog node to the end of your dialog tree, and add the anything_else special condition to its If assistant recognizes field.\n\nThe Anything else node provides the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* It prevents your assistant from ever going silent and failing to respond at all to your customers. The Anything else node is what enables your assistant to (if nothing else) say, I'm sorry, I didn't understand. or I can't help you with that.\n* The skill's analytics feature uses this node to learn about the topics that your dialog can't address. The coverage metric looks for occurrences of nodes with the anything_else condition being processed in the user conversation logs. It uses this information to determine the frequency with which your dialog is able to match user requests to intents that can address them. The node is registered by the metric if it conditions on anything_else alone or when it's used in combination with another condition, such as anything_else && positive_feedback.", "negative": "\nFor more information, see [the account credentials documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=uiviewing-credentials-ui).\n\n\n\n\n\n Is there a way to enable Key Protect on a Object Storage bucket after the bucket is created? \n\nNo, it is not possible to add Key Protect after creating a bucket.

But adding OOV words from a corpus that shows the words in the context in which they are used in audio can greatly improve transcription accuracy.\n\nThe service limits the number of words that you can add to a custom language model:\n\n\n\n* You can add a maximum of 90 thousand OOV words to the words resource of a custom model. This figure includes OOV words from all sources (corpora, grammars, and individual custom words that you add directly).\n* You can add a maximum of 10 million total words to a custom model from all sources. This figure includes all words, both OOV words and words that are already part of the service's base vocabulary, that are included in corpora or grammars. For corpora, the service uses these additional words to learn the context in which OOV words can appear, which is why corpora are a more effective means of improving recognition accuracy.\n\n\n\nA large words resource can increase the latency of speech recognition, but the exact effect is difficult to quantify or predict.

Discovery can calculate overall sentiment within a document, sentiment for user-specified targets, entity-level sentiment, quotation-level sentiment, directional-sentiment, and keyword-level sentiment. The combination of these capabilities supports a variety of use cases ranging from social media monitoring to trend analysis.\n\nExample portion of a document enriched with Sentiment Analysis:\n\n{\n\"text\": \"The stockholders were pleased that Acme Corporation plans to build a new factory in Atlanta, Georgia.\",\n\"enriched_text\": {\n\"sentiment\": {\n\"document\": {\n\"score\": 0.459813,\n\"label\": \"positive\"\n}\n}\n\nIn the preceding example, you could query the sentiment label by accessing enriched_text.sentiment.document.label\n\nThe label is the overall sentiment of the document (positive, negative, or neutral). The sentiment label is based on the score; a score of 0.0 would indicate that the document is neutral, a positive number would indicate the document is positive, a negative number would indicate the document is negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n Emotion analysis \n\nDetects anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness implied in English text. Emotion Analysis can detect emotions that are associated with targeted phrases, entities, or keywords, or it can analyze the overall emotional tone of your content.\n\nExample portion of a document enriched with Emotion Analysis:\n\n{\n\"text\": \"The stockholders were pleased that Acme Corporation plans to build a new factory in Atlanta, Georgia.\",\n\"enriched_text\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"document\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"disgust\": 0.102578,", "negative": "\nAfter adding or modifying a custom word, it is important that you verify the correctness of the word's definition; for more information, see [Validating a words resource for next-generation models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWords-ngvalidateModel-ng).

WhatsApp uses the phone Internet connection to send messages so customers can avoid SMS fees.\n\nThis integration creates a connection between your assistant and WhatsApp by using Twilio as a provider.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nIf you don't have one, set up a Twilio messaging account and get a phone number.\n\n\n\n1. Go to the [Twilio website](https://www.twilio.com/).\n2. Create an account.\n3. From the All Products and Services menu ![Twilio All products and services icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/twilio-products.png), click Phone numbers.\n4. Follow the instructions to get a phone number.\n\nWhen you get a Twilio phone number, it supports voice, SMS, and MMS automatically. Your new phone number is listed as an active number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ask WhatsApp for permission to enable your Twilio number for WhatsApp. \n\nWhatsApp has a rigorous process that they use to review all businesses that want to interact with customers over their network. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, requires that you register your business with the Facebook business directory.\n\n\n\n1."}
{"query": "I want to secure the phone connection before the phone interaction and optimize your actions for phone interaction.", "positive": "\nWhen you use the phone integration as the first line of assistance for customers, it's a good idea to have a live agent backup available. You can design your assistant to transfer a call to a human in case the phone connection fails, or if a user asks to speak to someone.\n\nYour company might already have one or more phone numbers that connect to an automatic call dispatcher (ACD) that can queue callers until an appropriate agent is available. If not, choose a call center service to use as your backup.\n\nA conversation cannot be transferred from one integration type to another. For example, if you use the web chat integration with service desk support, you cannot transfer a phone call to the service desk that is set up for the web chat.\n\nYou must provide the call center SIP URI for the call center service you use. You must specify this information in your assistant when you enable a call transfer from a dialog node or action step. For more information, see [Transferring a call to a live agent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsphone-actions-transfer).\n\n\n\n\n\n Optimize your actions for phone interaction \n\nFor the best customer experience, design your dialog with the capabilities of the phone integration in mind:\n\n\n\n* Do not include HTML elements in your action responses. To add formatting, use Markdown. For more information, see [Formatting responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-respondrespond-formatting).\n* You can use a search extension to include search results in actions that the phone integration will read. When search results are returned, the phone integration reads the introductory message (for example, I found this information that might be helpful), and then the body of only the first search result.\n\nThe entire search response (meaning the introductory message plus the body of the first search result) must be less than 5,000 characters long or the response will not be read at all. Be sure to test the search results that are returned and curate the data collection that you use as necessary.", "negative": "\nYou can use the same SIP account and phone number that you configured for use with Voice Agent with Watson in the phone integration.\n\nThe phone integration provides a more seamless integration with your assistant. However, the integration currently does not support the following functions:\n\n\n\n* Outbound calling\n* Configuring backup locations\n* Event forwarding to save call detail reports in the IBM Cloudant for IBM Cloud database service\n* Reviewing the usage summary page. Use IBM Log Analysis instead. For more information, see [Viewing logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phonedeploy-phone-logs).\n\n\n\nTo migrate from Voice Agent with Watson to the Watson Assistant phone integration, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the Voice Agent with Watson page, copy the phone number or numbers that you used for your SIP account.\n2. When you set up the Watson Assistant phone integration, add the phone number or set of numbers that you copied in the previous step.\n3. From the phone integration setup page, copy the SIP uniform resource identifier (URI).\n4. In your SIP trunk account, replace the Voice Agent with Watson URI that you specified previously with the URI that you copied from the phone integration setup page in the previous step.\n\nFor example, if you use a Twilio SIP trunk, you would add the assistant's SIP uniform resource identifier (URI) to the Twilio Origination SIP URI field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Call routing details \n\nIncoming calls to your assistant follow this path:\n\n\n\n1. A customer calls the customer support phone number that is managed by your Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk provider.\n2. The SIP trunk service sends a SIP INVITE HTTP request to your assistant's phone integration to establish a connection.\n3. The phone integration connects to the speech services that are required to support the interaction.\n4. After the services are ready, the connection is established, and audio is sent over the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).\n\nRTP is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks.\n5. The welcome node of the dialog is processed."}

{"query": "Speaking about bots again, can they get private information from the user", "positive": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "negative": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:"}

It is worth knowing your \"\"retirement savings number\"\".   If you are making $100K per year now, you need to target $2.5M - PLUS allowance for inflation between now and when you plan to retire. This usually means you need to also arrange to make more money as well as save as much as you can and to use passive investing.  Finance advisors are not worth it if you have less than $1M to invest.\"", "negative": "\nI don't know, maybe saving for 30+ years you'd want to see how your investments are doing to plan for retirement?

There's a table on one of the FIRE websites that shows a graph between % of income saved and the number of years it takes to save enough to be financially independent.  If you can go over 50% savings, you can get down to about 10 years.  In this case, financially independent is where you can live on a safe percentage of withdrawal from your savings without depleting the savings.  At that point, you no longer need to work for a paycheck.

Yes Are there pros and cons from a tax perspective?  Mostly pros. This has all of the benefits of an IRA, but if you use it for medical expenses then you get to use the money tax free on the other side. Retirement seems to be the time you are most likely to need money for medical expenses. So why wouldn't you want to start saving tax free to cover those expenses? The cons are similar to other tax advantaged retirement accounts. If you withdraw before retirement time for non-medical purposes, you will pay penalties, but if you withdraw at retirement time, you will pay the same taxes you would pay on an IRA. I should note that I put my money where my mouth is and I max out my contribution to my HSA every year."}

Since you're talking about an ADR of a company traded on LSE, it might be much safer that other, \"\"regular\"\", securities, but still it means that you're buying an unregulated security (even if it is of a company regulated elsewhere). Notice the volume of trades: mere thousands of dollars per day (in a good day, in some days there are no trades at all). It makes it harder to sell the security when needed.

Unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income. An example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that couldn't be sold again to pay off the debt. This is know as \"\"bad\"\" debt.

Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star.\r\n\t\n\nA supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star.\n\nAn illustration of one of the brightest and most energetic supernova explosions ever recorded. Image credit: NASA/CXC/M.Weiss\nWhat causes a supernova?\nOne type of supernova is caused by the “last hurrah” of a dying massive star. This happens when a star at least five times the mass of our sun goes out with a fantastic bang!\nMassive stars burn huge amounts of nuclear fuel at their cores, or centers. This produces tons of energy, so the center gets very hot. Heat generates pressure, and the pressure created by a star’s nuclear burning also keeps that star from collapsing.\nA star is in balance between two opposite forces. The star’s gravity tries to squeeze the star into the smallest, tightest ball possible. But the nuclear fuel burning in the star’s core creates strong outward pressure. This outward push resists the inward squeeze of gravity.\n\nWhat holds stars together? It’s a balance of gravity pushing in on the star and heat and pressure pushing outward from the star’s core.\nWhen a massive star runs out of fuel, it cools off. This causes the pressure to drop. Gravity wins out, and the star suddenly collapses. Imagine something one million times the mass of Earth collapsing in 15 seconds! The collapse happens so quickly that it creates enormous shock waves that cause the outer part of the star to explode!\nUsually a very dense core is left behind, along with an expanding cloud of hot gas called a nebula."}

How does light travel? What holds atoms and nuclei together?For centuries, scientists have sought to describe the forces that dictate interactions on the largest and smallest scales, from planets to particles. They understand that there are four fundamental forces — gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces — that are responsible for shaping the universe we inhabit.Gravitational ForceNASAThe most familiar force is gravity. It is responsible for keeping our feet on the ground and holding Earth in its orbit around the Sun.According to the general theory of relativity, gravity can be understood as bends and curves in the fabric of space-time that affect the motions of galaxies, stars, planets, and even light.", "negative": "What Is a Supernova? | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids\nWhat Is a Supernova? | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids\n\nsupernova\n\nVea en Español\n\nEarth\nSun\nSolar System\nUniverse\nScience and Tech\nEducators\n\nWhat Is a Supernova?\n\nThe Short Answer:\n\r\n\tA supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star.\r\n\t\n\nA supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star.\n\nAn illustration of one of the brightest and most energetic supernova explosions ever recorded. Image credit: NASA/CXC/M.Weiss\nWhat causes a supernova?\nOne type of supernova is caused by the “last hurrah” of a dying massive star. This happens when a star at least five times the mass of our sun goes out with a fantastic bang!\nMassive stars burn huge amounts of nuclear fuel at their cores, or centers. This produces tons of energy, so the center gets very hot. Heat generates pressure, and the pressure created by a star’s nuclear burning also keeps that star from collapsing.\nA star is in balance between two opposite forces. The star’s gravity tries to squeeze the star into the smallest, tightest ball possible. But the nuclear fuel burning in the star’s core creates strong outward pressure. This outward push resists the inward squeeze of gravity.\n\nWhat holds stars together? It’s a balance of gravity pushing in on the star and heat and pressure pushing outward from the star’s core.\nWhen a massive star runs out of fuel, it cools off. This causes the pressure to drop. Gravity wins out, and the star suddenly collapses. Imagine something one million times the mass of Earth collapsing in 15 seconds! The collapse happens so quickly that it creates enormous shock waves that cause the outer part of the star to explode!\nUsually a very dense core is left behind, along with an expanding cloud of hot gas called a nebula."}

Lessons About the Moon Explore our collection of standards-aligned lessons for grades 1-12. How it WorksAs the Moon orbits Earth, it goes through phases, which are determined by its position relative to Earth and the Sun. When the Moon lines up on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, we see a full moon. The new moon phase occurs when the Moon and the Sun are lined up on the same side of Earth.The Moon doesn’t orbit in a perfect circle. Instead, it travels in an ellipse that brings the Moon closer to and farther from Earth in its orbit. The farthest point in this ellipse is called the apogee and is about 405,500 kilometers from Earth on average. Its closest point is the perigee, which is an average distance of about 363,300 kilometers from Earth."}

It’s in the ground, forms big oceans, and it’s in our atmosphere.\nIt’s also in living things. Your body is made up mostly of water.\nWater covers 71 percent of Earth’s surface. And almost all of it—96.5 percent—is salt water. \nSalt water has different kinds of salt in it, but it mostly has sodium chloride, the same salt we add to our food.\nJust 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water we can drink. And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers.\nA third of the fresh water is in the ground. We call it groundwater.

It’s in the ground, forms big oceans, and it’s in our atmosphere.\nIt’s also in living things. Your body is made up mostly of water.\nWater covers 71 percent of Earth’s surface. And almost all of it—96.5 percent—is salt water. \nSalt water has different kinds of salt in it, but it mostly has sodium chloride, the same salt we add to our food.\nJust 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water we can drink. And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers.\nA third of the fresh water is in the ground. We call it groundwater. The last two percent of fresh water is in the rivers, lakes, and streams.\nA very small amount is in our atmosphere, where it exists as water vapor. That’s what clouds are made of.\nIf you took all the water on Earth and put it together it would be a ball 860 miles wide.

But what are supermoons, why do they occur and how can they be used as an educational tool. Plus, are they really that super? Lessons About the Moon Explore our collection of standards-aligned lessons for grades 1-12. How it WorksAs the Moon orbits Earth, it goes through phases, which are determined by its position relative to Earth and the Sun. When the Moon lines up on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, we see a full moon. The new moon phase occurs when the Moon and the Sun are lined up on the same side of Earth.The Moon doesn’t orbit in a perfect circle. Instead, it travels in an ellipse that brings the Moon closer to and farther from Earth in its orbit. The farthest point in this ellipse is called the apogee and is about 405,500 kilometers from Earth on average. Its closest point is the perigee, which is an average distance of about 363,300 kilometers from Earth."}

Utilizing this vehicle, the mission is targeting a launch in October 2024 on a Mars-Earth Gravity Assist (MEGA) trajectory that will arrive at Jupiter in April 2030.\n\nHow long will the trip to Europa take?\n\nJupiter is five times as far away from the Sun as Earth. The Europa Clipper mission will launch in October 2024 and will arrive in 2030, after a five and half year journey.\n\nWhy will the Europa Clipper spacecraft orbit Jupiter instead of Europa?\n\nEuropa Clipper’s orbit around Jupiter is preferable due to the belts of intense  radiation that surround the planet, which can damage electronics. Initial mission concept studies, which led to the Europa Clipper mission, showed that a spacecraft orbiting Europa might only be able to survive for months, while a Jupiter-orbiting mission should have a multi-year lifetime. The innovative design of the Europa Clipper trajectory allows about 50 flybys of Europa, each with a different close approach location, to allow almost the complete moon to be mapped at high resolution."}

Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL).

That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there – on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.", "negative": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nNearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit. While the astronauts may breathe 2 to 3 tons of oxygen in their 18-month stay on the planet, the ascent rocket would use 25 to 30 tons.\n\nHow much oxygen does MOXIE make?\n\nMOXIE was designed to make at least 6 grams of oxygen per hour. The maximum it can make is 12 grams per hour, although there isn't enough CO2 at our high-altitude Jezero crater landing site to make much more than 10. For comparison, you're probably using about 10 grams per hour while you're reading this explanation (unless you're riding your exercise bike while you're reading)!\nWhy so little? It takes a lot of power to pull apart CO2 molecules, and the Perseverance rover only provides about 100 Watts. That's not much more than the computer you're using to read this. If we're to make useful amounts of oxygen in the future, we'll need a much larger power plant.\n\nWhat does a MOXIE run look like?\n\nThe \"solid oxide\" in a solid oxide electrolyzer cell is a ceramic made mostly of zirconia that is heated to 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) inside a special miniature oven. When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance."}

The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'\nFuel needs oxygen to burn—for example, on Earth, oxygen is constantly being converted to carbon dioxide by animals, or fires, or other chemical reactions. Plants and trees use water and sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide back to oxygen, replenishing the air. On Mars, MOXIE also makes oxygen from carbon dioxide, about as much as a modest-sized tree, though using a very different process.\n\nMOXIE is a Scale Model for a Future Big MOXIE\nTo launch from Mars, a small crew of human explorers will need 25 to 30 tons of oxygen, or about the weight of a tractor-trailer!

ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make – well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called – coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air."}

{"query": "how long to cleart?", "positive": "Identity Theft Awareness - Privacy\nThe following are successful strategies for safeguarding your identity when away from home.\nClean out your wallet. Before you travel, plan to carry only the necessities for your trip and nothing extra. This way, if your wallet gets misplaced or stolen during your travels, you will have reduced the number of things that need to be replaced, as well as the amount of personal information that could be at risk.\nCopy and disperse copies of your identification. Do not keep all your identification or important documents in one location while you are traveling. Carry a photocopy of your passport in a different bag than your actual passport in case your passport gets lost or stolen during your trip. Having a photocopy and another form of identification available will be important if a passport needs to be replaced.\nLock up any valuables. If you are staying in a hotel, do not leave valuables or personal information out in the open. Be sure they are placed in your room’s safe. If your room does not have a safe, ask the hotel to lock up your valuables at the front desk. It is prudent to do this even if you are only going out for a few hours.\nSign out of your accounts. When you are traveling away from home, you might end up using a public computer at a hotel to check into your flight or to check your email. Make sure to sign out of any programs or accounts you use on public or shared computers before you walk away. Forgetting to do so can mean the next user can have access to your personal information.\nBe aware of your belongings. As tempting as it may be to rest your eyes on a plane, train, or bus, make sure you are vigilant about your belongings and your surroundings when using public transportation. Falling asleep could make you a potential target for theft.\nKeep laptops and other devices close. The airport security conveyor belt is a common place for laptop theft. Only place your computer on the belt when you are next in line, and always keep your eyes on it.\nWrite down important contact information.

{"query": "how long to cleart?", "positive": "Identity Theft Awareness - Privacy\nThe following are successful strategies for safeguarding your identity when away from home.\nClean out your wallet. Before you travel, plan to carry only the necessities for your trip and nothing extra. This way, if your wallet gets misplaced or stolen during your travels, you will have reduced the number of things that need to be replaced, as well as the amount of personal information that could be at risk.\nCopy and disperse copies of your identification. Do not keep all your identification or important documents in one location while you are traveling. Carry a photocopy of your passport in a different bag than your actual passport in case your passport gets lost or stolen during your trip. Having a photocopy and another form of identification available will be important if a passport needs to be replaced.\nLock up any valuables. If you are staying in a hotel, do not leave valuables or personal information out in the open. Be sure they are placed in your room’s safe. If your room does not have a safe, ask the hotel to lock up your valuables at the front desk. It is prudent to do this even if you are only going out for a few hours.\nSign out of your accounts. When you are traveling away from home, you might end up using a public computer at a hotel to check into your flight or to check your email. Make sure to sign out of any programs or accounts you use on public or shared computers before you walk away. Forgetting to do so can mean the next user can have access to your personal information.\nBe aware of your belongings. As tempting as it may be to rest your eyes on a plane, train, or bus, make sure you are vigilant about your belongings and your surroundings when using public transportation. Falling asleep could make you a potential target for theft.\nKeep laptops and other devices close. The airport security conveyor belt is a common place for laptop theft. Only place your computer on the belt when you are next in line, and always keep your eyes on it.\nWrite down important contact information. Keep a written copy or photocopy of important contact information, including your credit card company’s phone number, with you while you travel.", "negative": "Post-COVID Conditions: Information for Healthcare Providers\nCurrent U.S. government Long COVID research and plans for accelerating research and innovation in Long COVID are summarized in the National Research Action Plan on Long COVID.\nClinics for Post-COVID Conditions have been established at medical centers across the United States, bringing together multidisciplinary teams to provide a comprehensive and coordinated treatment approach to COVID-19 aftercare.\nCDC continues to actively investigate the full spectrum of COVID-19 illness, from the acute phase to long-term effects and conditions.

This is an excellent proposal. I am excited at the prospect of it receiving funding. Responsible use of public OHV lands will need funding as outlined in the application. Thank you for your consideration. Nathaniel Greensides - 4/17/2024\n\nI would like to comment on the Cleveland National Forest grant applications on behalf of the California Off Road Vehicle Association. I was in Corral Canyon today trimming Ranger trail with all the others at a trail working day. I thank Gabe for being there with us. I looked around and the area looks like it is well maintained. The grants for the north and south both look reasonable, even modest compared to others. What I would really like to see is an expansion of opportunities in Wildomar. 8 miles of trails is simply not enough. You say in the application that there are 20 million people and 729,000 OHV's in the region. I would love to see a general plan amendment to increase the amount of routes. I also saw you want to spend $65,000 to maintain those 8 miles at Wildomar. That is a crazy high amount of money for 8 miles. That is $8,000 per mile. How much work is really being done there? One pass in the spring should be 1/10 the cost. Maybe I should start a business, because I know I can save you a heck of a lot of money there. If I could have one wish granted from the CNF, I would ask for Carveacre trail to be re-opened. Ed Stovin - 5/4/2024\n\n USFS - Inyo National Forest\n\nThis proposal should be funded. The Covid pandemic brought a lot of people to our area who had no idea how to properly recreate in a rural environment and many caused damage. Since then our area has experienced a huge increase in the number of people who recreate in Inyo and Mono counties and that trend it is going to continue.

Image made from GOES satellite data.\n\nHurricanes are the most violent storms on Earth. People call these storms by other names, such as typhoons or cyclones, depending on where they occur. The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called \"hurricanes.\"\nWhatever they are called, tropical cyclones all form the same way.\n\nTropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Because this air moves up and away from the surface, there is less air left near the surface. Another way to say the same thing is that the warm air rises, causing an area of lower air pressure below.\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud. A tropical cyclone has so many of these, they form huge, circular bands.\n\nAir from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area. Then that \"new\" air becomes warm and moist and rises, too. As the warm air continues to rise, the surrounding air swirls in to take its place. As the warmed, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface. \nStorms that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise. Storms south of the equator spin clockwise. This difference is because of Earth's rotation on its axis.\nAs the storm system rotates faster and faster, an eye forms in the center. It is very calm and clear in the eye, with very low air pressure. Higher pressure air from above flows down into the eye."}

As with solar eclipses on the Earth, within the dark circle racing across Jupiter's cloud tops one would witness a full solar eclipse as Io passes in front of the Sun. Such events occur frequently on Jupiter because it is a large planet with many moons.

It's the largest planet in our solar system. If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside.Jupiter also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking only 10.5 hours to spin around once on its axis.Read MoreNASA’s Juno spacecraft took three images of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot on Feb. 12, 2019, that were used to create this color-enhanced view.Enhanced image by Kevin M. Gill (CC-BY) based on images provided courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSSExploring JupiterThe first detailed observations of Jupiter were made by Galileo Galilei in 1610 with a small, homemade telescope. More recently, this planet has been studied by orbiters, probes, and spacecraft passing by on their way to other worlds. NASA’s Juno spacecraft currently is studying the giant planet from orbit.
