# Cloud dataset splits
# Technical documentation query splits

train_queries: []  # Query IDs for training (80%)

val_queries: []  # Query IDs for validation (10%)

test_queries: []  # Query IDs for test (10%) - pseudo-test

# Split rationale:
# - Query-level splits for technical Q&A
# - Stratified by service/product category if applicable
# - 80/10/10 standard split
