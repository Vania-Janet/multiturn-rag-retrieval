# FiQA dataset splits
# Query-level splits for financial Q&A dataset

train_queries: []  # Query IDs for training (80%)

val_queries: []  # Query IDs for validation (10%)

test_queries: []  # Query IDs for test (10%) - pseudo-test

# Split rationale:
# - Query-level splits (no conversation structure in FiQA)
# - Stratified by query type if applicable
# - 80/10/10 standard split

split_strategy: query_level
total_queries: 0  # To be filled after data loading
split_ratio: [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]
stratification: query_type  # If multiple query types exist
