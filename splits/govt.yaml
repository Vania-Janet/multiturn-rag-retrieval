# Government dataset splits
# Document-set level splits for policy/regulation queries

train_queries: []  # Query IDs for training (80%)

val_queries: []  # Query IDs for validation (10%)

test_queries: []  # Query IDs for test (10%) - pseudo-test

# Split rationale:
# - Query-level splits ensuring no document overlap in judgments
# - Temporal split if dates available (older docs for train)
# - 80/10/10 standard split

split_strategy: query_level
total_queries: 0  # To be filled after data loading
split_ratio: [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]
temporal_split: false  # Set to true if using temporal ordering
